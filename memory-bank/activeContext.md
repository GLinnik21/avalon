## Current Focus

- Adapting the UserHoverCard component for mobile devices where hover interactions are not available
- Implementing a long press gesture using @vueuse/core to trigger the UserHoverCard on mobile
- Ensuring the existing click functionality for player selection remains intact
- Providing visual feedback for long press interactions on mobile devices

## Recent Changes

- Created detailed implementation plan for mobile adaptation of UserHoverCard
- Evaluated multiple approaches: custom directive, @vueuse/core, and Vuetify components
- Selected @vueuse/core solution for its balance of simplicity and functionality
- Documented mobile adaptation patterns in systemPatterns.md for future reference

## Open Questions/Issues

- Test the long press implementation on various mobile devices to ensure consistent behavior
- Consider if the 600ms delay for long press is appropriate for the user experience
- Evaluate if additional visual feedback is needed during the long press interaction
- Determine if any performance optimizations are needed for the modal dialog on lower-end devices
