## Completed Tasks

- Analyzed existing components and data structures related to user profiles and statistics
- Created initial implementation of UserHoverCard component
- Added necessary translations to all language files
- Implemented delayed hover functionality (1-second delay)
- Identified issues with the current implementation (positioning, overlapping)
- Researched existing tooltip patterns in the project
- Created detailed plan for improving the component using v-tooltip

## Current Tasks

- Modify Player.vue to use v-tooltip instead of direct inclusion of UserHoverCard
- Simplify UserHoverCard.vue by removing positioning styles
- Remove manual timer handling in favor of v-tooltip's built-in delay options
- Test the implementation in different screen positions and scenarios

## Next Steps

- Implement the v-tooltip-based solution according to the detailed plan
- Test the implementation thoroughly
- Consider additional user information that might be valuable in the hover card
